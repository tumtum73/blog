# Welcome to the DevOps Compass: Your Secret Decoder Ring for the IT Maze

# Intro
My name is Stephen Correia and I work in Volvo Transformation Labs and Enablement Services under the DevSecOps Chapter of Digital and IT.  I have worked for Volvo for almost 4 years and was promoted to Principal DevOps Engineer in January 2025.

We all know the 'Volvo IT maze' can be tough to navigate, but we're in this together. Consider this blog your personal decoder ring, helping you find the right path to more agile and stable development. My goal is to untangle the jargon and simplify your work life.

I plan to post Weekly on Monday but may get busy at times.

Got a question? Send it my way! There are no silly questions when we're all learning to read the new map.

Thanks,
Steve
